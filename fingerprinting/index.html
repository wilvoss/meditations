        <h1>What is Digital Fingerprinting?</h1>
        <p><strong>A digital fingerprint</strong> is a unique identifier created by collecting information about your
          device and
          browser.
        </p>

        <!-- <mobile-hidden> -->
        <p>Websites can save a fingerprint to recognize your device when you return. If a site keeps
          this
          identifier, it <strong>can detect repeat visits</strong> from the same browser. When combined with
          other
          data, such as
          cookies
          or login
          information, this allows websites <strong>to track users over time</strong>.</p>
        <!-- </mobile-hidden> -->

        <p>Third-party code from companies like Meta, Google, or
          Amazon is often included on websites
          to
          analyze traffic and support advertising. They can also save and track digital fingerprints,
          <strong>even if cookies are blocked
            or you are using private browsing</strong>.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h2>How can you protect yourself?</h2>
        <p>In addition to tweaking the most common browsers, consider using browsers that prioritize privacy and have
          built-in protections against tracking and
          fingerprinting, such as <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave</a> or
          <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Safari</h3>
        <p>Safari (v26) automatically injects noise into digital
          fingerprinting. <strong>"Use advanced tracking and
            fingerprinting
            protection" </strong>
          is located in the "Advanced" settings tab and has 2 levels of protection. Set
          yours to "in all browsing" or "All browsing"
          depending on your device.
        </p>
        <h3>Firefox</h3>
        <p>Firefox (v116) has a setting called <strong>"Resist Fingerprinting"</strong> that
          automatically injects noise into digital fingerprinting. It's located in the "Privacy & Security"
          section of settings under "Enhanced Tracking Protection". Be sure to set yours to "Strict". Learn more
          here: <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fingerprinting-protection" target="_blank">About
            Fingerprinting Protection</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Chrome</h3>
        <p>
          You can control site permissions (camera, mic, location) and manage extensions: <a
            href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/114662?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop"

            settings
            and permissions</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can reduce the number of extensions you use and disable unnecessary plugins to help lower your fingerprint
