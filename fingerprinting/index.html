        <h1>What is Digital Fingerprinting?</h1>
        <p><strong>A digital fingerprint</strong> is a unique identifier created by collecting information about your
          device and
          browser.
        </p>

        <!-- <mobile-hidden> -->
        <p>If a website saves
          this
          identifier, it <strong>can detect repeat visits</strong> from the same browser. When combined with
          other
          data, such as
          cookies
          or login
          information, websites and web services <strong>can track users over time</strong>.</p>
        <!-- </mobile-hidden> -->

        <p>Third-party code from companies like Meta, Google, or
          Amazon is often included on websites
          to
          analyze traffic and support advertising. They can also save and track digital fingerprints,
          <strong>even if cookies are blocked
            or you are using private browsing</strong>.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h2>How can you protect yourself?</h2>
        <p>You can change how your current browser behaves (see recommendations below). You might also consider using
          browsers that prioritize privacy and have
          built-in protections against tracking and
          fingerprinting, such as <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave</a> or
          <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/app" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Safari</h3>
        <p>Safari (v26) automatically injects noise into digital
          fingerprinting. <strong>"Use advanced tracking and
            fingerprinting
            protection" </strong>
          is located in the "Advanced" settings tab and has 2 to 3 levels of protection. Set
          yours to "in all browsing" or "All browsing"
          depending on your device.
        </p>
        <h3>Firefox</h3>
        <p>Firefox (v116) has a setting called <strong>"Resist Fingerprinting"</strong> that
          automatically injects noise into digital fingerprinting. It's located in the "Privacy & Security"
          section of settings under "Enhanced Tracking Protection". Be sure to set yours to "Strict". Learn more
          here: <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-protection-against-fingerprinting"
            target="_blank">About
            Fingerprinting Protection</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Chrome</h3>
        <p>
          You can control site permissions (camera, mic, location): <a
            href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/114662?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop"
            target="_blank">Manage
            settings
            and permissions</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can reduce the number of extensions you use and disable unnecessary plugins to help lower your fingerprint
          uniqueness: <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?hl=en" target="_blank">Install
            and manage extensions</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
        <p>Operating systems and browsers are becoming more aware of fingerprinting techniques and are implementing
          measures to mitigate tracking. Hopefully, over time the data tracked in the white box becomes signficantly
          less
          reliable
          or specific.</p>
        <p>You can toggle data on and off in the white box to see how the fingerprinting value changes.</p>
        <p>You can also check to see if the demo fingerprint value changes regularly. If
          it does,
          this is a sign that your fingerprint is harder to define and track!</P>
